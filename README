HACKMIT 2019 !!

> Choose between a private insurance system, a national model, or something else entirely. The global medical landscape at your fingertips.

> Democratize healthcare: empower users to choose between costs and benefits of distinct healthcare systems (eg. prioritize wait-time, quality, or affordability for each procedure)

> Given a target procedure or specialty, our application will present users with an intuitive overview of medical destinations that is complete with a breakdown of wait time, quality, and travel + treatment costs for the top medical facilities within each country.

> Used Django as the web framework with HTML/CSS/JavaScript in the front-end and PostgreSQL in the back. To aggregate travel information, we used the Amadeus API along with a simple cost-optimization algorithm. Additionally, we used python to write scripts for database seeding and web scraping.
